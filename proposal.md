# üß† AI-Powered Personal Study Planner

## Background
Many students struggle to structure their study time effectively before exams. Balancing multiple courses, deadlines, and limited energy often leads to inefficient study habits and stress. An AI-powered study planner can automate scheduling, reduce cognitive load, and help students achieve consistent progress through data-driven personalization.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a **web-based application** that generates a **personalized, adaptive study plan** based on:
- Exam dates and syllabus content  
- The user‚Äôs available study time  
- Their progress updates and preferences  

The system will automatically distribute topics, schedule repetitions, and dynamically reschedule sessions when users fall behind or complete topics early.

## Target Users
- **Primary Users:** University and college students preparing for multiple exams.  
- **Secondary Users:** High-school and adult learners balancing study with work or family commitments.

## Core Functionality

### Must-Have (MVP)
- ‚úÖ **AI-Generated Study Plan:** Automatically generate a day-by-day study schedule from uploaded syllabus and exam dates.  
- ‚úÖ **Customization:** Users can adjust available hours, weekends, and topic priorities.  
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Rescheduling:** Missed or completed sessions trigger real-time updates to the plan.  
- ‚úÖ **Authentication & Data Persistence:** Each user securely saves and retrieves their personalized plan.

### Nice-to-Have (Optional Extensions)
- ‚≠ê **Calendar Integration:** Sync sessions with Google or Outlook calendar.  
- ‚≠ê **Quiz/Flashcard Generation:** AI generates short review quizzes per topic.  
- ‚≠ê **Progress Visualization:** Display progress charts, motivational streaks, and badges.  
- ‚≠ê **Admin Panel:** Manage users and handle login issues (remove inactive users).  
- ‚≠ê **PWA Features:** Offline access and home-screen installation.
